# Div Brands Scales Global E-Commerce Operations with Netlify's Full-Stack Platform

**Executive Summary:** Div Brands, a custom outdoor apparel company, transformed from a drop-shipping startup to a full-scale manufacturing operation by building their entire technology stack on Netlify. By consolidating over 50 microservices into a unified platform they call "House," Div Brands achieved 100+ weekly deployments with 31 days of zero incidents, enabling their 70-person team to operate with unprecedented efficiency and visibility.

## From Startup Constraints to Enterprise Scale
**Global Operations, US-Based**

Div Brands faced the classic e-commerce dilemma: build fast on existing platforms like Shopify or invest in custom solutions for long-term flexibility. CTO Gus Fune and his team chose the latter, but needed a platform that could scale with their ambitions.

"We decided to not build on top of tools that exist like Shopify," explains Fune. "We built everything custom and everything is running on Netlify. The reason for that is it gives us flexibility to build different kinds of checkouts."

What started as a drop-shipping operation has evolved into a full manufacturing company shipping directly from the US, eliminating customs delays and improving customer experience.

## The Technology Foundation: Netlify as Platform
**Complete Digital Infrastructure**

Div Brands didn't just host their customer-facing store on Netlify—they built their entire business operations platform on it. Their internal system, called "House," consolidates over 50 different microservices into a unified experience.

The platform includes:
- Custom e-commerce storefront optimized for performance
- Real-time order tracking and fulfillment system
- Customer support portal with automated address changes
- Complete Product Information Management (PIM) system
- Engineering metrics dashboard with DORA and SPACE metrics
- AI-powered knowledge base and internal request system
- Incident management and alerting

"Most of the stuff we ask clubs to build are requests from other teams," Fune notes, highlighting how the platform serves all 70 employees across different departments with role-based access and functionality.

## Results: Operational Excellence at Scale
**Measurable Business Impact**

The results speak to both technical excellence and business outcomes:

**Key Metrics:**
- **100+ deployments per week** with streamlined CI/CD
- **31 consecutive days** without a single incident
- **67 hours average** from pull request to production deployment

**Business Outcomes:**
- Transitioned from drop-shipping model to full manufacturing and fulfillment
- Eliminated customs delays by shipping from US facilities
- Unified operations across 70 employees with department-specific dashboards
- Real-time visibility across entire supply chain and operations
- **4.18 team satisfaction score** on engineering metrics

"I'm super happy that whenever I need to push something live, I just click and close," says Fune. "We don't spend a lot of time on Netlify. We organize everything in a script and we just put it in there and it tells us it's good or bad."
